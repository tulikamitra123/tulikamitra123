                <h2>Be Happy</h2> <br>
        <p>Success and Happiness are the two magic ingredients that can make Life a Blessing. Being successful doesn’t guarantee your happiness. You might be the most successful person on the earth walking with all enviful eyes set on you. Your life might be the dream of thousands of others who go awe seeing your success and position. But deep down you might be unhappy. Your soul might be seething right under this cozy blanket of Success. On the other hand, you might not be successful and a mediocre person. May be failure doesn’t seem to leave your side but still, you are happy and contended. Because you never let the failure have the authority to trample your personal Happiness. You might have that might of being grateful for the obvious Bounties of life that the Creator bestowed on you that failure can hardly influence you negatively. Your gratitude towards the blessings of life that go unappreciated is what makes you unaffected and inert towards the failures, life keeps bouncing at you.

        <p style="margin-left: 5px;">Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes.
